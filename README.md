# SignalCheck Pro

This is not an open source project; releases are [only published on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueline.signalcheck).

SignalCheck Pro allows users to check the true signal strength and details about their connections. The standard Android signal bars and connection indicators are often inaccurate; SignalCheck shows you true detailed signal information about all of your device's connections, including 5G-NR, LTE (4G), 1xRTT CDMA, EV-DO / eHRPD, HSPA, HSDPA, HSPA+, HSDPA, HSUPA, and other GSM / WCDMA technologies. Data about your current Wi-Fi connection is also displayed, including signal strength, SSID, link speed, and IP address.
